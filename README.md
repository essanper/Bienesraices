This's a personal project.

I developed this website only with HTML and CSS, I use grid and flex for do it responsive, It haven't frameworks (Bootstrap, materialize) or libraries (JQuery, JavaScript).

This's a website static, only pages statics 

It haven't database or language back-end only Front-end (pages statics)
