This's a personal project.

I developed this website only with HTML and CSS, I use grid and flex for do it responsive, It haven't libraries/frameworks CSS (Bootstrap, Materialize) or libraries/frameworks front-end (JQuery, JavaScript, ReactJs)

This's a website static, only pages statics 

It haven't database or language back-end only Front-end (pages statics)
